Submitted by: **Atul Acharya**

Time spent: **~4-5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Additionally, implemented a Custom Transition to Settings View Controller, that shows a nifty way showing two View Controllers together (and Notification-based event passing between them).

## Notes

Implemented the fairly simple Tip Calculator. Challenges included implementing the custom transition to Settings. Used example from Apple's Custom Transitions app. 
Other challenges included trying to keep the design simple yet effective.
